# LCARS Kickers Interface

Welcome to the LCARS Kickers Interface! This Python repository provides a user-friendly application for registering foosball scores and maintaining a leaderboard. Leveraging Microsoft's TrueSkill algorithm, it tracks players' skills in both offense and defense, offering a comprehensive gaming experience.

## Getting Started

To launch the application, follow these simple steps:

1. Navigate to the `fusball/app` directory.
2. Run the following command:
    ```Python
    Python lcars.py
    ```

## Development Mode (Mouse Cursor)

During development or when not using a touch-screen, you might want to enable the development mode. To do so, set `DEV_MODE` to `True` in the `config.py` file. This allows you to visualize the mouse pointer, facilitating debugging and testing processes.

Enjoy the game and have fun competing with your friends!
